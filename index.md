Welcome to my website. My pronouns are they/them.

# Who Am I?
Hi! Thank you for taking time out of your day to check out my website!
I'm an 18y/o budding website designer and game developer aiming to build my skills and make something people can enjoy.
I know very little html, css, js--or any coding language for that matter--but I'm trying my best to learn as much as I can!

# What I Do
I am currently in the education system (Grade 12 to be exact), and I've been heavily enjoying Science (specifically botany) and English. During my free time, I play games, work on this website, and come up with ideas for new projects.
If you ever want to see my ideas, you can visit the "Ideas" page in the sidebar.
