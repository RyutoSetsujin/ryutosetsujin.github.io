Welcome to my website. My pronouns are they/them.

# Who Am I?
Hi! Thank you for taking time out of your day to check out my website!
I'm an 18y/o budding website designer and game developer aiming to build my skills and make something people can enjoy.
I know very little html, css, js--or any coding language for that matter--but I'm trying my best to learn as much as I can!

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, just click "[use this template]"!
